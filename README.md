### Disclaimer
This tool has not been audited for any vulnerabilities or side channel attacks, as such I recommend just using keepass or similar.

This was meant as a small side project to learn rust and svelte + some encryption stuff. The encryption scheme for the vault was loosly based on 1passwords white paper found here:
